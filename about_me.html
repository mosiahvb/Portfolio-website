                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p> 
                    I am Mosiah Valdez-Bates—a dynamic problem-solver forged through adversity.
                  Raised in poverty by a single mother, I learned early how to navigate tough 
                  environments. I’ve overcome abuse, battled dyslexia, and chose resilience
                  every step of the way. I don’t make excuses—I find solutions. When things
                  fall apart, I don’t point fingers. I ask, “What can I do today that 
                  will change everything six months from now?”
                </p>

                <p> 
                    I served as a missionary in Las Vegas, where I led service teams, taught 
                    English, and saw firsthand how grit, empathy, and leadership can change
                    lives. That experience shaped how I operate: I step up, adapt fast, and
                    lift others while I climb.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    I don’t just solve problems—I reframe them, break them down, and attack them
                    until they’re gone. I think dynamically, act strategically, and always keep 
                    the big picture in mind. No matter what comes my way, I never quit—and I
                    never will.
                </p>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>What I Bring to the Table</h2>
                <p> 
                    What I bring to the table isn’t just technical expertise; it’s a commitment to growth,
                     collaboration, and understanding. My ability to communicate effectively and read
                      others—whether it’s anticipating their needs or recognizing how best to support 
                      them—sets me apart. I’ve developed a deep understanding of human dynamics through
                       my personal and professional experiences, and I bring this skill to every team I’m part of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m not afraid to ask questions, challenge assumptions, or step outside my comfort zone.
                     I thrive on learning and continuously improving, even if it means failing and trying again.
                      I believe that humility and teachable moments are key to progress, and I’m always eager to 
                      grow both personally and professionally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What drives me most is the ability to see the bigger picture—understanding how my contributions
                     impact the team as a whole, and how I can help those around me shine. Whether I’m leading by 
                     example, supporting colleagues, or pushing for better outcomes, I always look for ways to 
                     make things work and improve processes along the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My work ethic, humility, and desire to learn are what I bring to every project. I’m passionate
                     about building strong, cohesive teams that leverage each person’s strengths 
                     and create something better than the sum of its parts.
                </p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p> 
                    <strong>Family Adventures:</strong> Spending time with my wife and daughter is my greatest joy. 
                    Whether we're exploring new foods, visiting amusement parks, or traveling 
                    the world to experience different cultures, I value these moments of connection 
                    and adventure. They remind me that balance is key to both happiness and success.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    <strong>Passionate About Communications:</strong> I’m fascinated by how communication works, from 
                    radios to cell phones to encryption. Currently, I’m working on an exciting project using MeshTastic,
                     an open-source software that lets me create mesh networks for secure, local communication—something
                      I find incredibly rewarding as it combines my love for tech with my desire for secure, reliable 
                      systems.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    <strong>Physical Fitness & Strength:</strong> Weightlifting is my main fitness focus, but I also enjoy swimming and sports.
                     Training is a way for me to challenge myself, build resilience, and maintain balance in life. I believe
                      the lessons learned in the gym—discipline, consistency, and persistence—translate directly to my work
                       and daily life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem-Solving & Learning:</strong> I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's dismantling 
                    technology to understand how it works or learning new software topics. I’m at my happiest when I’m deep in 
                    focus, figuring out solutions to tough challenges, and constantly evolving through the process.
