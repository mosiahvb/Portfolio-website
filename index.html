            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Mosiah Valdez-Bates. I am a husband, father, and a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, leadership, and adaptability.</p>
            <p>My diverse background—living in eight states, serving a two-year mission in Nevada, and working in sales and customer relations—has sharpened my ability to build trust, communicate effectively, and solve problems. I am known for being strong, kind, and resourceful, with a talent for learning quickly from mistakes and thinking outside the box to find efficient solutions. Leading teams, whether in Boy Scout troops, sports, or sales, has taught me the power of empathy, persistence, and collaboration.</p>
            <p>What sets me apart is my keen awareness of how actions impact others, my ability to foster collaboration by putting people at ease, and my sharp eye for patterns and abnormalities—whether in code, conversations, or challenges. I am driven by a desire to safeguard others, contributing to national security by developing innovative cybersecurity solutions. My ultimate goal is to work in national security, using my technical skills to protect and defend critical systems.</p>
            <p>With a strong determination to understand and develop technology and a natural ability to lead and adapt, I am ready to make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity field and look forward to the opportunities ahead.</p>
