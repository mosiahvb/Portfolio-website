            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am Mosiah Valdez-Bates—a relentless problem-solver with a Software Engineering degree, a foundation
                 in leadership, and the grit of someone who’s faced real challenges and never backed down. My 
                 strength lies not only in my technical ability to learn fast and deliver results, but also in my 
                 human skills: I read people, understand situations intuitively, and help teams thrive. I’ve cold-called 
                 door-to-door, led volunteer missions, and earned respect everywhere I've worked—not because I knew 
                 everything, but because I showed up, worked hard, and lifted others.</p>
            <p>I am driven by purpose, motivated by challenge, and energized by environments where iron sharpens iron.
                 I am looking to grow alongside passionate, high-performing teams who believe in doing good work for 
                 the right reasons. If you're looking for someone who brings fire, humility, and people-first instincts
                  into every project—I am that person.</p>
