              <h2>What It Is</h2>
              <p>This web application is designed to help users learn the fundamentals of first aid through a 
                structured, three-level learning path. Each level covers progressively more advanced life-saving 
                topics, from everyday cuts and scrapes to trauma response techniques like CPR and bleeding control. 
                Users can explore pre-set learning paths or curate a custom playlist of videos to study at their own pace.</p>

              <h2>Why I Built It</h2>
              <p>I was raised in a household of first responders and medical professionals — including my 
                great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and father — who passed down real-world medical 
                knowledge and the importance of being prepared to help others. I created this website to 
                make basic, life-saving first aid skills accessible to those who didn’t grow up with the same 
                training. It's alarming that roughly 31,000 people die each year from preventable blood loss 
                after car accidents — often because no one nearby knows what to do. This site is my way of 
                sharing that critical knowledge.</p>

              <h2>How I Built It</h2>
              <p>
                This site was built with a minimal HTML structure — almost everything you see on the page
                 is dynamically generated using JavaScript. The JavaScript handles the heavy lifting: it 
                 loads data from local JSON files, organizes it, formats the content, and injects it into the 
                 HTML. Aside from the basic layout like the navigation and header, all of the educational 
                 content, video embeds, and user interactions are managed through JavaScript. The design is 
                 styled with CSS, but the core functionality is powered by JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                This site is structured around a three-level learning system:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Everyday first aid (cuts, scrapes, burns).</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Serious incidents (CPR, fractures).</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Trauma response (bleeding control, emergency care).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Content is loaded from local JSON files, and instructional videos are embedded from YouTube. 
                I used JavaScript and browser localStorage to let users build a custom "Watch List" 
                playlist. Users can mark videos as completed, which removes them from their list and helps track 
                learning progress.

              <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
              <p>
                I started this project with a simple design sketch to guide the development process. 
                My focus was on building the core functionality first, then refining the user experience through iteration.
              </p>
              <p>Key lessons I learned during the process include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modular JavaScript:</strong> I struggled to consolidate multiple functions into reusable modules, 
                  especially when working with asynchronous JSON data. This is an area I plan to revisit and improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Video Performance Optimization:</strong> Embedding YouTube videos directly slowed down page load times.
                   I’m researching lazy loading techniques and thumbnail previews to improve performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Iterative Learning:</strong> Testing in small steps helped me identify problems early. 
                  Each feature taught me to think like both a developer and a designer.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>

              <h2>What I'd Do Differently</h2>
              <p>
                As I reflect on this project, there are several things I would approach differently if I were starting over:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1:</strong> Plan for modular code earlier to make JavaScript functions more reusable and easier to maintain.</li>
                <li><strong>2:</strong> Structure JSON and video content with scalability in mind — allowing future updates to be more seamless.</li>
                <li><strong>3:</strong> Prioritize responsive design from the start to avoid reworking layout for mobile devices later.</li>
                <li><strong>4:</strong> Implement lazy loading and thumbnail previews sooner to improve video performance and loading times.</li>
                <li><strong>5:</strong> Focus more on accessibility, including keyboard navigation and clear contrast for users with visual impairments.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This project has been a meaningful learning experience, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. Going forward, I plan to build on this foundation with better practices, more features, and a sharper focus on user needs.
